<p>Welcome to our project idea web page!</p>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> The app that scores coding skills history. Empowering recruiters with data-driven insights and candidates with a
    platform to showcase expertise. Streamline tech hiring today! </p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
    Many companies and recruiters struggle to efficiently assess the coding skills and expertise of job candidates
    during the hiring process. Traditional methods of evaluating coding abilities, such as technical interviews or
    reviewing resumes, may not provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of a candidate's coding history and
    skill progression. Similarly, candidates often find it challenging to showcase their coding skills effectively,
    leading to potential mismatches between their capabilities and the opportunities available.

    The lack of a standardized and data-driven approach for evaluating candidates' coding skills history poses a
    significant challenge for both recruiters and job seekers. Recruiters may struggle to identify the most suitable
    candidates for technical roles, while candidates may find it difficult to demonstrate their coding expertise in a
    structured and organized manner.
<ul><B>Key issues highlighted by statistics:</B>

    <li>40% Loss in Efficiency: Companies suffer a considerable 40% loss in hiring process efficiency due to ineffective
        coding skill evaluations.
    </li>

    <li>200k Cr. Loss in Revenue Annually: The absence of a standardized and data-driven assessment leads to an
        estimated annual revenue loss of 200k Cr. for companies.
    </li>

    <li>2 Lakh Deserving Individuals Unmatched: Around 2 lakh deserving individuals miss out on opportunities they
        deserve due to the shortcomings in the evaluation process.
    </li>

    <li>Extended Hiring Time: Traditional hiring can take up to 30 days or more, resulting in delays and increased costs
        for companies.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    To address this problem, we aim to develop a web application that offers a solution for objectively scoring
    candidates based on their coding skills history. The app will provide a platform for candidates to log their coding
    experiences, projects, and technical accomplishments. By analyzing the coding history data, our app will generate a
    comprehensive score that reflects a candidate's proficiency in different programming languages, frameworks, tools,
    and the complexity of their completed projects.

    With this app, recruiters and companies will have access to a data-driven scoring system, allowing them to make more
    informed decisions during the hiring process. Additionally, candidates will have a standardized platform to showcase
    their coding expertise, increasing their chances of finding the most suitable job opportunities.

<ol><B>The main objectives of the app are as follows: </B>

    <li> To create an efficient and transparent system for scoring candidates based on their coding skills history.</li>
    <li> To offer recruiters an insightful tool for identifying candidates with the appropriate technical expertise for
        specific job roles.
    </li>
    <li> To provide candidates with a structured platform to present their coding achievements and stand out in the job
        market.
    </li>
    <li> By addressing these challenges and objectives, our app seeks to bridge the gap between candidates and
        recruiters, leading to better matches and more successful hiring outcomes in technical roles.
    </li>

</ol>

</p>


<h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
<p>
    The market opportunity for an app that scores candidates based on their coding skills history is significant, given
    the increasing demand for skilled technical professionals and the challenges faced by both recruiters and job
    seekers in the hiring process. Here are some key factors contributing to the market opportunity: </p>
<ul>
    <li> TAM: The global recruitment market is valued at $200 billion, and the portion focusing on technical hiring
        represents a significant segment.
    </li>
    <li> SAM: The platform targets SMEs, startups, and tech-driven companies, representing a $50 billion market
        opportunity.
    </li>
    <li>SOM: By offering an efficient, AI-powered solution, we aim to capture 10% of the SAM, translating to a $5
        billion obtainable market.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app's potential global reach, catering to candidates and recruiters across industries, makes it an attractive
    investment opportunity in the dynamic recruitment technology space. With the increasing demand for skilled technical
    talent and the adoption of data-driven decision-making in hiring, our scoring app is poised for substantial growth
    and impact on the recruitment landscape.
